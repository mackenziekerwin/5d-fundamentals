    <p>The baseball cap is constrained in size and shape--it is hollow, semi-spherical, and roughly the size of the human head. The user wears it on the head because it would not fit anywhere else. It is worn with the brim in the front because our eyes are sensitive to light--a human-related constraint. The use of the baseball hat also depends on (and is thus constrained by) the environment, as it would be rather useless on a dry, overcast day. Finally, the baseball hat is constrained by a cultural expectation that we associate others with the messages worn on their hats. Our emotional attachments to hats influence how we view others within our culture.
