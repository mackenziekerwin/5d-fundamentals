    <p>The hollowed-out shape of the baseball hat perfectly covers a human head and therefore affords wearing, but once inverted, it reveals more hidden affordances like scooping and containing smaller items. In addition, the sturdy, opaque brim effectively blocks light from entering the eyes and thus affords seeing. It is soft and flexible, implying affordances like folding, twisting, and adjusting. A skinny protruding tab at the back of the object simply begs to be pulled, allowing the hat to be resized. And yet, the solidity of the cotton shows that it is durable and can offer light protection from precipitation, dirt, and other environmental debris.
