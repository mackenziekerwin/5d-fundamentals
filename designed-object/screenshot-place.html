    <p style="padding-left:120px">This first AR experience showcases the baseball hat in its natural
      state--resting on a shelf, ready to be plucked and taken out for the day.
      The experience contains two separate images: the background plate and the
      transparent hat. The background is the shelf without the hat, so when the
      image is brought to life, the hat rests on the foreground, and the shelf
      can still be seen behind it.

    <p style="padding-left:120px">The Artivive app allows augmented reality
      experiences to be viewed right on your mobile device. To the right is a
      screen-recording of what happens when you try it out: simply point the
      camera at a picture of the artwork and watch the image come to life!
