    <h1 class="info">the idea</h1>
    <p>I can clearly envision a large sculpture of a baseball cap at a
      campground. People who go camping tend to set up tents scattered about, so
      the sculpture would be particularly effective if the hat was placed in an
      arbitrary location on the grass, mimicking the idea of a family picking a
      favorable location to “set up camp”. I came up with this idea after
      noticing that tents and baseball hats share a dome shape and have a large
      opening. If scaled correctly, a giant hat sculpture would blend into a
      line of tents and even encourage campers to crawl inside.

    <p>The purpose of this exhibit is to demonstrate what a baseball hat truly is--essentially,
      it is just a container. It contains your head, providing a bit of shelter
      against unfavorable weather conditions. It can also contain smaller objects
      like trinkets and toys, or it can provide shelter for a mouse. On a larger
      scale, its affordances are the same. Once it is big enough for a person to fit
      inside, it’s clear that what matters more than the baseball hat is what goes
      into it.
