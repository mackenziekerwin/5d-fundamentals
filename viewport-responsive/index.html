			The toolbar appears vertically on the left side of the Document window, and is visible in all views - Code, Live, and Design. The buttons on the toolbar are view-specific and appear only if they are applicable to the view you are working in. For example, if you are working in Live view, then Code view-specific options such as Format Source Code are not visible. Else if you are working in Live view, then Code view-specific options such as Format Source Code are not visible and there some other menu items there also. But Code, Live, and Design are visible. Yet, we still cannot see the end of the rainbow.
