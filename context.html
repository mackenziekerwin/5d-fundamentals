    <h1 class="info">the baseball hat in context</h1>
    <p>The modern-day baseball cap covers and protects the head, assists seeing
      in bright atmospheres, and offers some personalization to individual
      wardrobes. It consists of two main parts: a soft, circular crown and a
      stiff, slightly curved brim. The baseball capâ€™s design offers both utility
      and style, making it a common staple in wardrobes across societies.
