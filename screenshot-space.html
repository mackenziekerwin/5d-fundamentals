    <p>This second experience places the baseball hat in a more dramatic
      context, putting the hat in a tent-sized form that actually allows
      crawling inside. Just like the other AR experience, the background is
      made up of a picture of a campground without the sculpture. When the hat
      is revealed, the background maintains its visibility, and it look like
      the sculpture is resting in the front.
